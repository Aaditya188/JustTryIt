## Our Inspirarion
The whole revolution that this pandemic brought upon our lives has only sped up the process of every business going online. In such times, where e-commerce and e-shopping sites were already booming, having no choice but take to online shops has somewhere changed the user experience dynamics. Decision making is tougher in certain areas,  a major one being fashion. 
Choosing apparels and accessories by looking at them on models only pose a limited imagination, and thus the whole tedious process ordering and returning becomes a task in itself for both customers and brands. Hence, we thought of bringing the experience of offline shopping to the customers at home by using virtual reality and AI.
